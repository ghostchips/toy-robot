 To launch the program run the ruby app in the terminal.

 I chose to use Ruby for this exercise because of my familiarity with the language's object-oriented programming and because I felt it was suitable because a visual component was not required.

 I wanted to separate concerns so I chose to create classes for all the commands, one for creating a table and determining the table size, and one for the toy robot and all its possible commands.

 The main app file has a method that asks the user to input commands and later translates those string commands into the toy robot methods.
